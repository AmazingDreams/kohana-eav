Entity-attribute-value model (EAV) is a data model to describe entities where the number of attributes (properties, parameters) that can be used to describe them is potentially vast, 
but the number that will actually apply to a given entity is relatively modest. In mathematics, this model is known as a sparse matrix. 
EAV is also known as object-attribute-value model, vertical database model and open schema.
